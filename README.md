# Overview
In this project, I analyzed trends in hiring rates, turnover rates, and other employee KPIs from 2014 to 2020.

The findings indicated a consistent increase in the number of employees, accompanied by a decline in turnover rates annually, from 13.83% in 2015 to 3.13% in 2019, and a slight decrease in hiring rates year-over-year, from 1.76% in 2015 to 1.13% in 2019.

Further analysis of employee distribution by level and gender unveiled disparities in managerial positions, with 30 out of 157 male employees and 12 out of 142 female employees holding such roles.
